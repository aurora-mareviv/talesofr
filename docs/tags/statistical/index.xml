      <description>Current state of the matter The reason for bringing this here is that I witnessed an interesting exchange some time ago, regarding one article and their use of post-hoc power, pinpointed by @ADAlthousePhD:

      <description>Playing with my tablet some time ago, I wondered if installing R could be possible. You know, a small android device “to the power of R”…
After searching on Google from time to time, I came across some interesting possibilities:

 R Console Free. provides the necessary C, C++ and Fortran compilers to build and install R packages.</description>
