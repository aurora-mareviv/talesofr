      <description>Background A hospital may be defined as a place, or building, or set of facilities where patients go to receive the care they need.
In ancient times, a hospital was not much more than a hotel for the poor, where they could stay and be cared for. Some centuries passed, and now we call hospitals to extremely complex structures, from both physical and functional perspectives.</description>

      <description>The R-Spain Conferences have been taking place since 2009 as an expression of the growing interest that R elicits in many fileds. The organisers are the Comunidad R Hispano (R-es). The community supports many groups and initiatives aimed to develop R knowledge and widen its use.
To attend the talks by streaming (they are in Spanish) you must registrate.
There is also a scientific programme with the presentations (some in English) here.</description>
